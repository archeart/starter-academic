I am broadly interested in theoretical computer science. My recent research interests are query complexity, communication complexity and analysis of boolean functions. 

I am currently a postdoc at Weizmann Institute of Science. I obtained my Ph.D. degree at University of California, Los Angeles (UCLA). I am extremely fortunate to have [Prof. Alexander Sherstov](http://web.cs.ucla.edu/~sherstov/) as my advisor. My disseration is {{< staticref "files/dissertation.pdf" "newtab" >}} Communication and Computation {{< icon name="file-pdf" pack="fas" >}}{{< /staticref >}}. I also spent two fantastic years as a postdoc member at Institute for Advanced Study, under the supervision of [Prof. Avi Wigderson](https://www.math.ias.edu/avi/home).  Before UCLA, I obtained my Bachelor's degree at Nanjing University and Master's degree at Dartmouth college.

and {{< staticref "files/research.pdf"  >}} research statement{{< icon name="file-pdf" pack="fas" >}}{{< /staticref >}}.
